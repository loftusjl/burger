# Burger Bonzai
A project using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM

## Getting Started

* Visit the live [Heroku Site](https://enigmatic-lowlands-17209.herokuapp.com/)
    * Please be patient. If no one has visited it recently it takes a second to spin up the server.
* Available Burgers
    - Click "Burger Time!" to eat a burger.
    - The burger will be removed from the available burgers section and be placed in the Burgers Devoured section.
    - On the back end, the burger records are being updated in the MySQL database.
* Burgers Devoured
    - The exact opposite of the Available Burgers section.
* All burgers have a trash icon. This will delete the burger from the database.
* Add a burger
    - In this form you can enter the name and the URL of a photo of the burger you'd like to add to the list.
